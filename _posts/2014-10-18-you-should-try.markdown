<p>
You may say i have nothing <br>
You may say i have something <br>
It comes from your eye <br>
Baby, you should try
</p>

<p>
Keep my eyes open <br>
Walking through the line <br>
Try not to look down <br>
Baby, you should try
</p>

<p>
Don’t carry on <br>
For what i’ve done <br>
Cause i’ll be home <br>
Baby, you should try
</p>

<p>
Stranded in blue <br>
Where they’re all gone <br>
But still i need some <br>
Baby, you should try
</p>

<p>
I’m not what you are..<br>
Baby, you should try
</p>

<p>
When i was there <br>
Where they’re all gone <br>
When I’m on my own <br>
Baby, you should try
</p>
