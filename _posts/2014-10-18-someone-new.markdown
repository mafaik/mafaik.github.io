<p>
So bright and blue <br> 
So shine and bold <br>
So sharp and full <br>
I saw you so
</p>

<p>
Please tie it back <br>
It’s so clearer <br>
Show me your smile <br>
I like you so
</p>

<p>
Sweet as sugar <br>
Soft as a pillow <br>
Warm as a blanket <br>
That’s how you really are
</p>

<p>
What can i do <br>
I want to show you <br>
How all these things <br>
Make me someone new
</p>

<p>
How can i show you this love <br>
It’s killing me <br>
I’m so numb when i’m around you
</p>

<p>
Nothing but you <br>
Make me someone new <br>
Losing my mind <br>
And i can’t explain
</p>
